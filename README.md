# Fundraising Manager for SII

## üßæ Overview
The project is a backend REST API developed for the recruitment task by SII Polska. The goal is to create a system for managing collection boxes used during charity fundraising events. The system helps charity organizations track collection boxes, manage their assignments, handle donations in multiple currencies, and generate financial reports per event.

## üéØ Features
- Register and manage **collection boxes** with unique identifiers
- Assign boxes to **fundraising events** (only if empty)
- Add money to boxes in multiple currencies (right now only: EUR, GBP, PLN, USD)
- Transfer money from boxes to event's accounts with **currency conversion** (based on exchange API: *https://open.er-api.com/v6/latest*)
- Automatically empty collection boxes upon unregistration
- Generate **financial reports** showing the total collected balance per event in its designated currency.

## üß© Technical Stack
- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Maven**
- **H2 Database** (for development and testing)
